# Low-Power AI/ML Hardware Battery Life Optimization

This project will focus on how to improve battery life for a low-power SoC system. Researchers will explore the impacts that different power modes (e.g., clock gating, power gating, voltage and frequency scaling, and the corresponding changes to SoC inference runtimes) will have on end-to-end battery life.
